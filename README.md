# WordPress Plugin: LiteSpeed Downloads for WooCommerce

Enables LiteSpeed downloads via X-LiteSpeed-Location, which is the LiteSpeed equivalent to X-Sendfile/X-Accel-Redirect. We created this plugin to improve the speed and stability of downloadable products in WooCommerce whenever WooCommerce is running on the LiteSpeed web server.
